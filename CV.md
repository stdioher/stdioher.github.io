### Personal Profile

I am an Associate Professor and Assistant Dean at the College of Cyber Security, Jinan University. My research interests include AI security and multimedia security. 

I have published over 30 papers in international journals and conferences, including IEEE TIFS and IEEE TCSVT. I have applied for or been granted over 10 invention patents, including 2 international patents, and have participated in developing 3 industry standards. I have led more than 10 research projects, including sub-projects of the National Key R&D Program, the General/Youth Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), and projects from the Key-Area R&D Program of Guangdong Province.

I have served as the Organizing Committee Chair for CryptoIC 2023, a network review expert for the National College Student Information Security Contest, and a committee member for several technical committees, including the CSIG Technical Committee on Digital Media Forensics and Security. I am also a reviewer for several well-known journals, including IEEE TIFS, IEEE TDSC, and Journal of Software.
