## Abstract

Existing methods for reversible data hiding in ciphertext binary images only involve one data hider to perform data embedding. When the data hider is attacked, the original binary image cannot be perfectly reconstructed. To this end, this letter proposes multi-party reversible data hiding in ciphertext binary images (MRDHCBI), where multiple data hiders are involved in data embedding. In this solution, we use visual cryptography technology to encrypt a binary image into multiple ciphertext binary images, and transmit the ciphertext binary images to different data hiders. Each data hider can embed data into a ciphertext binary image and generate a marked ciphertext binary image. The original binary image is perfectly reconstructed by collecting a portion of marked ciphertext binary images from the unattacked data hiders. Compared with existing solutions, the proposed solution enhances the recoverability of the original binary image. Besides, the proposed solution maintains a stable embedding capacity for different categories of images.
