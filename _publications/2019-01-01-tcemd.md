## Abstract

Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) have recently attracted considerable attention from both industry and academia for improving road safety and traffic efficiency. Trust modeling plays a significant role in VANETs, however, the existing trust models cannot primely conform to the characteristics of VANETs. This article proposes a novel trust cascading-based emergency message dissemination (TCEMD) model which incorporates the entity-oriented trust values into data-oriented trust evaluation in an efficient manner. In the proposed model, when an emergency event (e.g., an obstacle in front of the road) occurs, the emergency messages can be disseminated among the nearby vehicles in a trust cascading manner, where the entity-oriented trust values (which are evaluated and updated by leveraging the trust certificates and are contained in the messages) are adopted as important weights. Subsequently, the theoretical analysis for the robustness against several kinds of attacks and malicious behaviors, failure tolerance features, compatibility for several kinds of special situations, and incentive mechanisms in the TCEMD model are detailed. Afterwards, a series of simulations and analyses are conducted in a typical highway environment, and the results reveal that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing models in several cases.
